Just a heads up, many of my mods use uasset files for them to work. With the addition of dedicated servers these can cause problems as the servers are in beta. I will not be doing any further testing as my results so far have been so inconsistant. I am waiting until servers come out of beta before further testing as I feel most the issues will be resolved.

My mods will soon be switched over to EXMOD zip files as these will allow downloading and adding to Mod Manager without any issues even if they are months old. So once this is done the only way to use my mods would be through Mod Manager.When this next version is released there will be no need to go searching for mods as they will all be avail in Mod Managers download Database page.
