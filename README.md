# Icarus_Mods


5/22/22 Updated mods to week 24. Added new weapons mod. This mod adds 2 new handguns,3 assault rifles, and a sniper rifle. They are all tier 4 items. The weapons mod uses D_ProcessorRecipes, D_ItemsStatic, D_ItemTemplate, D_AmmoTypes, D_FirearmData, D_Actionable, D_Ballistic, D_Itemable, D_Meshable. So unfortunately will prob be incompatible with other mods. If another mod creator wishes to add all or one of these weapons to their mod  they are free to do so. Enjoy

-No custom animations so I had to get creative with polishing them and getting them to reload/aim the right way. 

-Sniper and 1 assault rifle use custom overlay for the binoc to resemble looking through a scope. Works nicely.

-Hand guns use same ammo as pistol doing same damage but are semi-auto with 10 round mag. Reloads the 10 rounds in one animation. 

-2 assault rifles use iron sights and all 3 rifles use 10 round mag but have to be loaded 1 round at a time as there are no mag reload animations for rifles.

-Sniper rifle uses sniper ammo that does more damage than any other round but also is more difficult to craft. 1 shot then reload.

5/6/22  Updated Mods to latest game data. Added More variety for the jump mods. The default jump height is 525. My old high jump was 900 so you now have options.

4/28/22 Uploaded new mods. Use gravity/jump mods with caution as a fall from high may kill! Also added Friendly wolf mod. They will attack and kill anything in the wild. They have been bread to be friendly with humans but dont attack or they will turn!

4/14/22 Updated explosive Arrows for week 19.

4/8/22 Updated Explosive Arrows for week 18. Kryptic camo mod does not need any update.

4/6/22 Added New Kryptic camo mod. 
This new camo mod should be compatible with all other mods unless the mod changes these same item textures. I dont think any other mods change textures so you should be fine. Also this mod DOES NOT CHANGE the gameplay in any way. It only changes the look of the workshop armor, Compound Bow, Recurve bow, and the Archers Backpack.
Just select the Kryptic_Camo_Mod_V1_P.pak file for the items you want to be camo from the files section and place in mods folder:
\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods
if that folder doesnt exist, just create it. You can add all of them if you wish. I had to break them up do to file size limits.


Explosive Arrows MOD. This Mod allows you to take any arrow above stone and craft it into an explosive arrow. The base damage is the same as the arrow you start with. The explosion does damage depending on how close to the target it explodes. Any animal that is not killed will become slowed from the explosion. KillCam is disabled with these new arrows as wounds are inflicted from the explosion. All base stats of each arrow remain the same as the original.

To craft an explosive arrow you must have an arrow to start with. The minimum is bone arrow. Items needed to craft are the original arrow plus 1 leather, 4 gunpowder, and 2 epoxy. You craft these in your character crafting near bottom of your list of craftable items. In order to craft an explosive version you must have the original version unlocked in blueprints. Once crafted you will see the same type arrow but with and explosion displayed next to the arrow icon. This same Icon is used in the arrow select screen when using your bow. It also says in the description that the arrow is explosive. These arrows are new items so they will not stack with regular arrows.

To install just add the PAK file to your mods folder in your Icarus installation directory.

I have included the source folders for adding these arrows to other mods. They are 6 all new arrows so they will not effect any changes you have made to existing ones, or any changes to other items. You will just have to insert the json to your json files and add the additional BP and Assets folders and files before compiling to PAK file.
