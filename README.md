Explosive Arrows MOD. This Mod allows you to take any arrow above stone and craft it into an explosive arrow. The base damage is the same as the arrow you start with. The explosion does damage depending on how close to the target it explodes. Any animal that is not killed will become slowed from the explosion. KillCam is disabled with these new arrows as wounds are inflicted from the explosion. All base stats of each arrow remain the same as the original.

To craft an explosive arrow you must have an arrow to start with. The minimum is bone arrow. Items needed to craft are the original arrow plus 1 leather, 4 gunpowder, and 2 epoxy. You craft these in your character crafting near bottom of your list of craftable items. In order to craft an explosive version you must have the original version unlocked in blueprints. Once crafted you will see the same type arrow but with and explosion displayed next to the arrow icon. This same Icon is used in the arrow select screen when using your bow. It also says in the description that the arrow is explosive. These arrows are new items so the will not stack with regular arrows.

To install just add the PAK file to your mods folder in your Icarus installation directory.

I have included the source folders for adding these arrows to other mods. They are 6 all new arrows so they will not effect any changes you have made to existing ones, or any changes to other items. You will just have to insert the json to your json files and add the additional BP and Assets folders and files before compiling to PAK file.
